## MNIST Autoencoder

An autoencoder specifically for the MNIST dataset that uses convolutions, transpose convolutions, and fully connected layers.

This compresses the image from 786 dimmensions down to 128.

## Usage
```python
>>> python autoencoder.py
```

Batch size is set to 1000 so you might want to change it depending on your system.

### Results
